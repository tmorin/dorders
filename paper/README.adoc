== Abstract

`dorders` is a virtual platform helping people to exchange locally goods and services.
Its purpose is to help little and local economic agents to practice their activities without dependencies on bigger ones.
The platform relies mostly on Internet embracing a decentralized system as well as a peer-to-peer architecture.

== Introduction

////
- The closure or unattractiveness of exchange places slows down the day to day economy.
- The lack of fairness in Neoliberalism makes big fishes bigger whereas weaker are weakens.
--> act more locally, be more humanness
- but WE are humans
- so WE are part of the problems
- therefore WE are part of the solutions
--> promote local initiatives with humanness
- use an existing infrastructure
- use an existing architecture
--> a decentralized system hosted on internet
- local empowerment
- self-organization
--> a peer-to-peer architecture:
- human scale
- resilient
- sustainable pace of growth
////

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Pandemic forces a part of the humanity to experience a new pace of life.

The basic protective measures, but also the more restrictive ones like the confinement, change the way humans interact socially.
Confined or crowded places should be avoided.
Social distancing is encouraged.
Hands have to be washed frequently to not contaminate goods or to not be contaminated by them.
All those measures are welcome and required to preserve the health systems and to save lives too.
However, all those changes have an impact on the day to day economy.
They impact the local producers, the shops owners ... anyone which produces or sells locally goods and services.

Basically, the usual places where to locally sell and buy goods are closed or unattractive.
Nevertheless, those places are a key factor of the day to day economy.
They are needed for sellers to show goods and buyers to be aware of them.
They are the malls, the shops, the markets, the streets ...

The Coronavirus disease Pandemic also shows weaknesses of the dominant ideology: the Neoliberalism.

This ideology emphases several policies like globalization, free trade, deregulation, privatization ...
This pandemic shows their limits.
Applying them, nations become inter-dependants about everything, even vital goods like foods, medicines, health materials, etc.
Moreover, capabilities of nations to produce goods is being also affected by the offshoring practices which destroy locally the know-how and expertise.
Finally, the model is mainly beneficial for big actors like multinationals and transnationals, especially when independents workers or small companies have to suspend their activities.

The slow down of the day to day economy as well as the lack of fairness in Neoliberalism provide signals.
Signals which could say: act more locally, be more humanness.

We are humans and as humans, we are impacted by the pandemic.
We have to take care of us and others staying at home or going outside to work.
We have to accept reduction of social interactions, unexpected delivery dates or lack of goods.
We have to deal with our beliefs, fears and wishes.

Front of a broken economy where big fishs become bigger whereas weaker are weakens, what could we do?
Could we be able to act more locally?
Could we be able to be more humanness?

In fact, there is a place to boost local initiatives far from big fishs.
As well as there is a place to transform self-interest to common-interest.
This place is close, very close to us.
It is already available at home, at work, in our smartphones or other connected devices.
It is Internet, a network of networks natively designed to host decentralized systems.

A decentralized system leverages on the empowerment of its nodes, and their self-organization.
Those building blocks help to design a solution embracing a peer-to-peer architecture.
A solution which is able to promotes local as well as human interactions.
A resilient solution able to grow and diminish at a sustainable pace.

`dorders` is the name of the described solution.
It is the concatenation of the letter *d* of decentralized with the word *orders*.

== Definition

`dorders` is a virtual platform helping people to locally exchange goods and services.

virtual:: It means the solution mostly relies on Internet.
platform:: It means the solution mostly relies on specifications, protocols and libraries rather than a unique and ready-to-use implementation.
helping:: It means the solution provides a set of heterogeneous services supporting the exchange processes of goods and services.
In other words, the solution doesn't provide a ready-to-use and global way to exchange.
people:: It means the solution mostly focuses on human interactions.
locally:: It means the solution mostly focuses on hand-to-hand exchanges.

== Domain

> *domain*: a sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity.
The subject area to which the user applies a program is the domain of the software. +
> - <<dddref>>

The domain of the `dorders` platform is the decentralized management of orders within the scope of local transactions.

The platform focuses on two main purposes:

. provide a trusted relationship between two entities
. provide services to help the orders fulfillment

The following scenarios express them in common usual situations.

=== Scenario A: Alice, Bob and the grocery

This scenario regards local shops selling goods to regular customers in face to face.

. Alice sells goods in her grocery.
. Bobs usually buys goods in the Alice's shop.
. However, Bob wants to spend as less time as possible in the shop due to protective measures.
. Therefore, Alice creates the profile in `dorders` of her shop to make its catalog available remotely.
. Alice invites Bob to be a client of her shop in `dorders`.
. So that, Bob can browse the catalog and place an order remotely.
. Once received, Alice confirms it, processes it and notifies Bob when completed.
. Finally, Bob goes to the shop, pays and comes back home with the ordered goods.

=== Scenario B: Alice, Bob and the one-way marketplace

This scenario regards ephemeral exchanges where the catalog as well as the client relationship aren't persistent.

. Alice sells vegetables every Saturday in the weekly marketplace of her town.
. Bobs usually buys vegetables at the Alice's spot.
. However, due to protective measures the authority limits the flow of persons in the marketplace.
. Therefore, Alice creates the profile in `dorders` of her business to make its weekly catalog available remotely.
. The authority provides it at the entry of the marketplace.
. So that, waiting for an entry to the marketplace, Bob can use his smartphone to browse the catalog in `dorders` and place an order remotely.
. Once received, Alice can start to process the order according to the flow of clients.
. Once Bob reaches the Alice's spot, he can quickly pick up the order and so help to improve the flow of persons.

=== Scenario C: Alice, Bob and the weekly point of sell

This scenario regards exchanges with final customers beside a main activity.

. Alice produces vegetables in her farm.
. Alice opens a point of sell in his farm for local customers.
. The point of sell opens on Friday afternoon and Saturday morning.
. However, due to protective measures the authority limits the flow of persons in local shops.
. Therefore, Alice offers to her customers to place orders remotely and pick up the items during the opening hours.
. Each Saturday afternoon, Alice publishes in `dorders` the catalog of the week and opens the order submissions.
. Each Tuesday at noon, Alice closes the order submissions.
. During the Tuesday afternoon, Alice reviews the orders and confirm them.
. On Wednesday and Thursday, Alice processes the orders and notifies the counter parts (i.e. Bob).
. Therefore, Bob knows the status of the order, and he's can find missing articles somewhere else.
. Finally, on Friday, coming back from his job, Bob can pick up his order at the point of sell.

== Concepts

> *concepts*: a general idea or understanding of something +
> - https://www.wordnik.com/words/concept[wordnik]

`dorders` involves many concepts picked from other domains related to e-commerce, trade, supply chain ...

[#concept_actor]
=== Actor

An actor represents a single person, a group of persons or an abstraction of both.
It can be an individual, an organization, a company ...

An actor exists in `dorders` throughout at least one profile.

.The Concept Diagram of Actor
image::concepts_actor.png[]

* An actor can create many profiles.
* A profile belongs to only one actor.

[#concept_profile]
=== Profile

A profile presents its actor.
It is also its entry point to interact with `dorders`.
A part of the profile is public, and the other one is private.
The purpose of the public profile is to present the actor and to reference other public data which belongs to it.
The purpose of the private profile is to store data which cannot be public or which are not ready to be.

.The Concept Diagram of Profile
image::concepts_profile.png[]

* The private profile belongs to only one profile.
* The public profile belongs to only one profile.

[#concept_peer]
=== Peer

A peer is a link between the physical world and the virtual one.
For an actor, a peer hosts profiles data.
It also provides an interface to manipulate them.
For the network, it is a cache of public data which can be used by any other peers.

.The Concept Diagram of Peer
image::concepts_peers.png[]

* A peer only hosts profiles of its actor.
* A profile can be hosted by one or many peers.
* A profile must be at least hosted by one alive peer to exist.

[#concept_contact]
=== Contact

A contact is the reference of a public profile.
It is like an entry of an address book.

.The Concept Diagram of Contact
image::concepts_contact.png[]

* A profile can create many contacts.
* A contact belongs to only one profile.
* A contact references another profile.

[#concept_relationship]
=== Relationship

A relationship is a link between two profiles.
It is an agreement to share mutual data.

.The Concept Diagram of Relationship
image::concepts_relationship.png[]

* A relationship references two profiles.
* A profile can be referenced by many relationships.

[#concept_catalog]
=== Catalog

A catalog is a comprehensive list of the products.
This contains all the data related to the products including product images, descriptions, specifications, price and user reviews. <<magglo>>

Labels can be used to mark products in order to group them or to find them accurately.

.The Concept Diagram of Catalog
image::concepts_catalog.png[]

* A profile can create many catalogs.
* A catalog belongs to only one profile.
* A catalog can create many labels.
* A label belongs to only one catalog.
* A catalog can create many products.
* A product belongs to only one catalog.
* A product can be marked by many labels.

[#concept_order]
=== Order

An order is an instruction created by a profile (i.e. the consumer) of a relationship to get a set of products picked from the catalogs of the other one (i.e. the provider).
An order has a list of items which reference products.

.The Concept Diagram of Order
image::concepts_order.png[]

* A relationship can create many orders.
* An order has a consumer.
* An order has a provider.
* An order can contain many items.
* An item is a reference to a product.

== Characteristics

> *characteristic*: a prominent attribute or aspect of something. +
> - https://www.wordnik.com/words/characteristic[wordnik]

In order to provide a solution which is _more local_ and _more human_, `dorders` embraces key characteristics.

////
--> truthfulness
--> elastic
--> privacy

--> human scale
--> local empowerment
--> self-organization
////

[#characteristics_truthfulness]
=== Truthfulness

> *truthfulness*: the character of being truthful: as, the truthfulness of a person or of a statement. +
> - https://www.wordnik.com/words/truthfulness[wordnik]

In order to safely practice exchanges, each part of the relationship must trust the other one.

In `dorders`, the creation context of a <<concept_relationship>> leads to its level of truthfulness.
The value is not mutual among sides of the relationship, each one own its level of truthfulness.
The creation process initialize the value.
Then, the level can be manually updated.

When both sides, together, trigger and confirm manually the relationship, then the level of truthfulness is by default _high_ for both.
It can be the case when the creation context involves mobile applications exchanging data locally in realtime, for instance scanning a QR-Code or establishing a Bluetooth connection.

When only one side triggers manually the creation of a relationship and then wait for the confirmation from the other side, so then, once confirmed, the level of truthfulness is by default _moderate_ for both side.
It can be the case when the creation context involves an "invitation" which can be accepted or ignored, for instance an URL sent by email or instant messaging.

When only one side triggers automatically the creation as well as the confirmation of a relationship, then the level of truthfulness is by default _low_ for both sides.
It can be the case when the creation context involves a public portal where people can create their "invitations" them-self, for instance a web form sending an "invitation" on submission.

Another source of truthfulness is the history of a relationship.
It contains all significant messages which has been exchanged within it.
The recorded messages cannot be updated or deleted, they are immutable.
Therefore, the history of a relationship can also be used as an audit log of the relationship.
This pattern is in fact the building block of the data management in `dorders`: everything can be audited.

[#characteristics_elastic]
=== Elasticity

> *elasticity*: the throughput of a system scales up or down automatically to meet varying demand as resource is proportionally added or removed. +
> - <<reaglo>>

`dorders` promotes a decentralized system based on a peer-to-peer architecture.
Therefore, the platform involves autonomous and self-organized xref:concept_actor[Actors].
An actor owns at least one xref:concept_peer[Peer] within the `dorders` network.
A peer hosts xref:concept_profile[Profiles] of the actor as well as public data fetched from other peers.

==== Profile duplication

A profile can be duplicated in many peers, so that the actor can access to them from different interfaces, places ...
The profile duplication can also be used for backup purpose.

The actor _Alice_ uses two peers:

. her smartphone, the _Alice Smartphone_
. and the grocery's laptop, the _Grocery Laptop_

_Alice_ has two profiles:

. her personal profile, the _Alice Profile_
. and the profile of her grocery, the _Grocery Profile_

As shown below, both peers host _Grocery Profile_ but only _Alice Smartphone_ hosts _Alice Profile_.

.Elasticity: hierarchy view of Alice and her profiles
image::characteristics_elastic_hierarchy_1.png[]

At her own pace, _Alice_ can create or destroy peers.
She can also manage their profiles with the same manner.

If tomorrow, _Alice_ buys a new smartphone (_Alice Smartphone New_), she will import the profiles from _Alice Smartphone_ to _Alice Smartphone New_.
As shown below, after the import, both smartphones will have the same content.

.Elasticity: hierarchy view of Alice and her profiles with the new smartphone
image::characteristics_elastic_hierarchy_2.png[]

She can now use _Alice Smartphone New_ and reset to factory settings _Alice Smartphone_ in order to recycle it.

In this layout, _Alice_ is also safe if _Grocery Laptop_ suddenly dead, because _Grocery Profile_ is at least replicated by her smartphone.
So that, after the purchase of a new laptop, _Alice_ will be able to replicate _Grocery Profile_ in this new peer from her smartphone.

==== Layered connections

The elasticity of `dorders` happens in three main layers.

. The network of actors is the first layer.
. The network of peers managed by actors is the second layer.
. The network of profiles hosted by peers is the last layer.

In each layer, nodes can appear as well as disappear at any time.
Actors are free to create, maintain or leave a relationship.
Actors are free to create or destroy peers.
Finally, actors are free to create or remove profiles from their peers.

.Elasticity: layered view of networks
image::characteristics_elastic_layered.svg[]

[#characteristics_privacy]
=== Privacy

> **privacy**: the state or condition of being free from being observed or disturbed by other people. +
> - https://www.wordnik.com/words/privacy[wordnik]

`dorders` recognizes only three levels of privacy: _private_, _relational_ and _public_.
A _relational_ or _public_ data cannot become _private_, because by essence shared with other actors.

Due to the xref:characteristics_truthfulness[truthfulness characteristic], and especially its immutability about data, it's not possible to physically _delete_ or _update_ something in `dorders`.
Only the so called _create_ and _read_ operations coming from the _CRUD operations_ are allowed.
That means, data of the levels _relational_ and _public_ cannot be _deleted_ or _updated_.

==== Private

Private data can only be get and mutated by their owner.
For instance, the private part of a profile can only be get and mutates by its actor.

A private data still remains at the _private_ scope as long as its actor makes it _relational_ or _public_.
For instance, by default a created catalog is _private_ and hosted in the private profile.
Once published, the catalog becomes public and therefore hosted in the public profile.

==== Relational

Relational data can only be get and mutated by the participants of the underlying <<Relationship>>.
For instance, a relationship hosts all data related to its orders.
Only both sides of the relationship can get and mutate them.

==== Public

Public data can be seen by anyone, however only its actor can mutate them.
For instance, a public catalog can be seen by anyone, but only the actor of the related profile can update it.

=== Interoperability

> **interoperability**: the ability to exchange and use information (usually in a large heterogeneous network made up of several local area networks). +
> - https://www.wordnik.com/words/privacy[wordnik]

The `dorders` platform inter-connects xref:concept_peer[Peers] in order to exchange data.

The solution relies on existing communication protocols to create and maintain the connection between peers as well as the transit of data.
About ready-to-use technologies, two candidates are available.
The first one is IPFS <<ipfs>> with the addition of OrbitDB <<orbitdb>>.
The second one is Blockstack <<blockstack>>.
Both approaches emphases the previous characteristic: <<characteristics_truthfulness>>, <<characteristics_elastic>> and <<characteristics_privacy>>.

The solution relies on existing solutions as common data format.
About ready-to-use technologies, many candidates are available.
The closer solutions to the `dorders` domain are :

- Schema.org <<schema>> for the vocabulary
- JSON for Linking Data (JSON-LD) <<jsonld>> for the encoding/decoding

== Design

The main purpose of the present design is to provide a model which promotes the emergence of various implementations.

It relies on the following approaches:

- Hexagonal Architecture <<hexarch>>
- Domain Development Design <<ddd>>
- CQRS <<cqrs>>
- EventStorming <<evstorm>>

[#design_peer]
=== Module peer

==== Start and stop the local peer

At any time a peer can be available or unavailable.
A peer is available because it has been _started_.
On the other hand, a peer is unavailable because it has been _stopped_ or simply never started.

According the point of view, a peer can be _local_ or _remote_.
The present design focuses only on the _local peer_.

.EventStorming Diagram of the peer module
image::design_peer_eventstorming.png[]

==== Model

The aggregate `LocalPeer` is an interface which extends the interface `Peer`.

The factory `LocalPeerFactory` is an interface which is responsible to create instances of `LocalPeer`.

.UML Class Diagram of the peer module
image::design_peer_model.png[]

[#design_profile]
=== Module profile

==== Create a profile

[story-create_profile]
....
As user,
I want to create a profile,
So that, I could exist in dorder
....

The command `CreateProfile` initiates the creation of a profile from scratch.
Its logic creates and persists a new `PrivateProfile` aggregate.
The publication of the event `ProfileCreated` indicates the completion of the command.

.EventStorming Diagram of the profile module - create a profile
image::design_profile_eventstorming_create.png[]

==== Import a profile

[story-import_profile]
....
As user,
I want to import an existing profile hosted in another device,
So that, I could use the same profile in the other device
....

The command `ImportProfile` initiates the import of a profile hosted somewhere in `dorders`.
Its logic creates and persists a new `PrivateProfile` aggregate.
The publication of the events `ProfileCreated` indicates the completion of the command.

.EventStorming Diagram of the profile module - import a profile
image::design_profile_eventstorming_import.png[]

==== Update the profile card

[story-update_profile_card]
....
As user,
I want to update the card of one of my profile
So that, I could adapt it 
....

The command `UpdateProfileCard` initiates the update of the profile card of a hosted profile.
Its logic updates a `PrivateProfile` aggregate.
The publication of the event `ProfileCardUpdated` indicates the completion of the command.

.EventStorming Diagram of the profile module - update the profile card
image::design_profile_eventstorming_update_profile_card.png[]

==== Delete a profile

[story-delete_profile]
....
As user,
I want to delete a profile on my current device
So that, it won't be anymore available from the device
....

The command `DeleteProfile` initiates the deletion of a hosted profile.
Its logic physically deletes a `PrivateProfile` aggregate.
The publication of the event `ProfileDeleted` indicates the completion of the command.

.EventStorming Diagram of the profile module - delete a profile
image::design_profile_eventstorming_delete.png[]

==== Load profiles

[story-load_profiles]
....
As user,
I want to have synchronized profiles once my device is started
So that, I won't miss important information
And my device will be able to provide the most accurate data
....

Once the local peer is online (i.e. _started_), the hosted profiles have to be loaded.
So that, their contents will be available fo other `dorders` peers.

The process starts on the event `LocalPeerStarted`.
For each hosted profile, the process creates its aggregate and publishes the related event `ProfilesLoaded`.
The publication of the event `ProfilesLoaded` indicates the completion of the process.

.EventStorming Diagram of the profile module - load profiles
image::design_profile_eventstorming_load_profiles.png[]

==== Synchronize profiles

[story-synchronize_profiles]
....
As user,
I want to have an automatic synchronization of the content of hosted profiles among my devices 
So that, I won't miss important information
And my devices will be able to provide the most accurate data at any time
....

The data of a private profile can be updated at any time by any peers which hosts it.
The peer-to-peer technology used to implement the model should provide the mechanism to synchronize profile data among the peers.
The mechanism can be foreground as well as background.

The process `ProfileSynchronizer` is responsible to deal with the ongoing synchronizations.
Its purpose is to start or monitor the ongoing synchronizations as well as the publication of events accordingly.

For each published `ProfileCreated` event, the process loads the related aggregate and delegates to the infrastructure side the management of the synchronization as well as the eventual publication of events `ProfileSynchronized`.

.EventStorming Diagram of the profile module - start or monitor the ongoing synchronizations
image::design_profile_eventstorming_synchronize_profiles.png[]

==== Model

A part of a _profile_ is _public_, and the other one is _private_.
In the present design, the _public_ side is a subset of the _private_ one.

The aggregate `PrivateProfile` is an interface which extends the interface `Profile`.
On the other side, the value object `PublicProfile` is also an interface which extends the same interface `Profile`.

The factory `PrivateProfileFactory` is an interface which is responsible to create instances of `PrivateProfile`.

The repository `PrivateProfileRepository` is an interface which is responsible to persist and load instances of `PrivateProfile`.

.UML Class Diagram of the profile module

[#design_contact]
=== Module contact

==== Add a contact

[story-add_contact]
....
As user,
I want to add contacts in the "contact book" of my profiles
So that, I could quickly access to the public profile of others dorders actors
....

The command `AddContact` initiates the addition of a new contact.
Its logic creates and persists a new `Contact` aggregate.
The publication of the event `ContactCreated` indicates the completion of the command.

.EventStorming Diagram of the contact module - add a contact
image::design_contact_eventstorming_add.png[]

==== Rename a contact

[story-rename_contact]
....
As user,
I want to rename contacts of my profiles' "contact book" 
So that, I could make the contact more personal
....

The command `RenameContact` initiates the update of a contact.
Its logic changes the name of a `Contact` aggregate and persists it.
The publication of the event `ContactRenamed` indicates the completion of the command.

.EventStorming Diagram of the contact module - rename a contact
image::design_contact_eventstorming_rename.png[]

==== Remove a contact

[story-rename_contact]
....
As user,
I want to remove contacts of my profiles' "contact book" 
So that, I could discard the useless ones 
....

The command `RemoveContact` initiates the deletion of a contact.
Its logic physically deletes a `Contact` aggregate.
The publication of the event `ContactDeleted` indicates the completion of the command.

.EventStorming Diagram of the contact module - remove a contact
image::design_contact_eventstorming_remove.png[]

==== Load contacts

[story-load_profiles]
....
As user,
I want to have synchronized contacts 
When my device is started
....

[story-load_profiles]
....
As user,
I want to have synchronized contacts
When a profile is imported
....

Once a `PrivateProfile` aggregate is _created_, the related contacts have to be loaded.

The process starts on the event `ProfileCreated`.
For each contact related to the created profile, the process creates the `Contact` aggregate.
The publication of the event `ContactsLoaded` indicates the completion of the process.

.EventStorming Diagram of the contact module - load contacts
image::design_contact_eventstorming_contacts_loader.png[]

==== Synchronize the contact's data

[story-load_profiles]
....
As user,
I want to have at any time the most updated data for each contact
....

Once a `Contact` aggregate is _created_, the related data have to be monitored.

The process starts on the event `ContactCreated`.
Then the process delegates to the service `ContactSynchronizationService` the monitoring of the ongoing synchronization.
The service publishes the event `ContactSynchronized` each time data are synchronized.

.EventStorming Diagram of the contact module - synchronize the contact's data
image::design_contact_eventstorming_contact_synchronizer.png[]

==== Synchronize the contact lists

[story-load_profiles]
....
As user,
I want to have my contact lists synchronized among my devices
....

Once a contact list is _mutated_, the changes have to be handled on peers which replicates the same profile.

The process starts on the event `ProfileSynchronized`.
Then, the process delegates to the service `ContactSynchronizationService` the merging logic.
The publication of the event `ContactsSynchronized` indicates the completion of the process.

.EventStorming Diagram of the contact module - synchronize the contact lists
image::design_contact_eventstorming_contacts_synchronizer.png[]

==== Clear contacts's data

Once a `PrivateProfile` aggregate is _deleted_, the related contacts's data have to be deleted as well.

The process starts on the event `ProfileDeleted`.
For each contact related to the deleted profile, the process deletes the `Contact` aggregate and publishes the related event `ContactDeleted`.
The publication of the event `ContactsDeleted` indicates the completion of the process.

.EventStorming Diagram of the contact module - clear contacts's data
image::design_contact_eventstorming_contacts_clearer.png[]

==== Model

The aggregate `Contact` is an interface which relies on the value object `PublicProfile` to expose the public profile of the related profile.

The factory `ContactFactory` is an interface which is responsible to create instances of `Contact`.

The repository `ContactRepository` is an interface which is responsible to persist and load instances of `Contact`.

The service `ContactSynchronizationService` is an interface which is responsible to manage the ongoing synchronizations.
